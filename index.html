        <p style="text-indent:30px;">I created the above slide exercise ahead of a workshop I was to lead in London in December 2017. I can see it so perfectly still in my memory. We were in the Expedia building across the street from the main Angel Building headquarters of my previous department. The location we were in was breathtaking.  To set the scene, we were set on top of the Angel train Station. Our block had a pub the locals would take us to when we visited. Up the walkway, there was a small café that, at the time, had McTyre’s coffee (known for exceptional quality) sponsored. Once you enter the Expedia building, there are booths just across from the check-in counter. Next to the booths there sat a conference room that is dedicated to the beloved Majesty the Queen herself. There were portraits of Queen Elizabeth all alongside the walls as well as the British flag colors embroidered on the wallpaper. It was truly a majestic scene. But I digress, back to the purpose of the Prototype exercise workshop I shared at the start. Three or four floors above Queen Elizabeth, we had a large room all to ourselves. When I say we, I mean the Agile Coaching team.  Little did we know at the time, but we were on the precipice of pushing the boundaries between Agile, UX, and Marketing Research discovery. At least that is what my experience was alongside a few others.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px;">During this workshop, I followed the exercise rules precisely as I laid out in the exercise instructions. That was the only way to fully ensure we tried to emulate that of a compact stressful real-life software development scenario to meet end users' needs. If memory serves me well, we had such a fun and intense time. We split into two teams and at the end I had both teams provide a demonstration of their prototype. I remember one team created a pamphlet for the new hire onboarding experience. I can’t remember what the other team produced. Overall, there was a roller coaster of emotions from intense, dramatic, laughter and pure enjoyment. It’s not as important that I remember what we demonstrated accurately. The key was to ensure all parties walked away with a greater appreciation for what our software developers, marketing researchers, product managers, stakeholders, and end users must endure when prototypes are created and reviewed. Although at the time of that workshop, I didn’t have an ROI predicted for the value this workshop delivered, I do not doubt that the members of the exercise took these learnings and applied them through and through with all their teams and interactions. The ripple effect of this event and the power of prototyping products has and will continue to bring more value than previous generations could have ever predicted. I hope one day I get the opportunity to lead such workshops again but with a more experienced eye in User Experience Research and Design domain expertise. That said, we are always learning and should never underestimate the value we bring in the pursuit of our end-user journey!</p>
